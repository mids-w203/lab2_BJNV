# Peer Review

We are going to ask the same set of four questions about each of the members of your team, including yourself. 

Each student will submit their own, confidential peer evaluation to Gradescope. Like all educational assignments, we are required by federal policy to keep your responses in confidence, meaning that we cannot share them with anyone else, including your teammates. Instructors will use feedback from this peer evaluation, together with their own observation of the teams' work and process to assign participation scores for each teammate. 

Please answer each of these prompts with a sentence or two.

# Teammate #1: {Fill in Name}

1. **In your view, what are this person's strengths?** Always brilliant, hard working, and really challenged us to develop our model into its best form. 
2. **How well did this teammate communicate? Did they let you know when they were able to meet and when they were not able to meet? Was this teammate willing to share their ideas with an eye toward improving the project?** Yes! Donna was a proactive communicator. Donna's meme game was on point, and when they disagreed with some part of the work within the project, it was always justified with reasons related to the approach or statistics, and it was never, *ever* a personal issue. 
3. **Was this teammate an active contributor to the team? Did they do what they said they would? Did they work at the level of effort they communicated? Was this level appropriate for the project?** Oh, goodness yes. 
4. **In your view, are there any areas where this person could, or should, improve? If so, what are these areas?** Honestly, none that we see.
